# Superman Token

Superman Token is an ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity. It extends OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and ERC20Burnable contracts and includes Ownable functionality.

## Features

- **ERC-20 Compatibility:** The contract implements the ERC-20 standard with essential functions like `transfer`, `approve`, and `balanceOf`.

- **Burn Functionality:** Utilizes the `ERC20Burnable` contract, allowing token holders to burn their own tokens.

- **Ownership Control:** Inherits from the `Ownable` contract, providing the ability to designate an owner with exclusive control over certain functions.

- **Minting:** Includes a `mint` function that allows the owner to mint new tokens for designated addresses.

## Overview
